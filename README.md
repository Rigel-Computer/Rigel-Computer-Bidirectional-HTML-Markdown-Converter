# HTML ↔ Markdown Converter (Bidirectional)

This project is a spontaneous spin-off from real-life development work – imagined and implemented with the help of ChatGPT.

## 🔄 What does this tool do?

This tool allows you to convert **HTML ↔ Markdown** in both directions – right in your browser, without any server or installation. Just type into the HTML or Markdown field, and the other side will update in real time.

The **smart download button** detects whether you've entered HTML or Markdown – and offers the appropriate `.html` or `.md` file for download.

## 🧩 Features
